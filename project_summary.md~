## Description

From little 3 "mandala coloring books" I enjoy the mandala therapy proccess. Now, I want to mixture these handmade colouring art in a rotative panel.

## Link to Prototype

I believe I'll put a small panel demonstrating the prototype soon.

[See here it working!](http://mandala.ideia.me "")

## Example Code

The code will be hosted on github [here](https://github.com/jonatas/mandala).

The [example is here](http://jsfiddle.net/kFmY8/1060/ "JSFiddle with the complete code").

The image is unaligned, but covers the concept. The idea is incomplete because I'll crop only the circular part of the image, and combine different directions and speed.

So, with a basic circular image:


```
<img class="rotate" src="http://distilleryimage9.ak.instagram.com/9540a5784a5a11e384640eda85d08e73_8.jpg">
```

And a webkit rotation effect:

```
.rotate {
  -webkit-animation: rotation 0.5s infinite linear;
}

@-webkit-keyframes rotation {
  from {-webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);}
  to   {-webkit-transform: rotate(359deg);}
}
```

Now, based on these concepts, my idea is allow the user to combine and create a cool panel of mandalas, rotating in different speeds, sizes, positions in the screen.
