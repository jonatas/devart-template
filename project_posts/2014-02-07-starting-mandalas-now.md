So, today is my first day on the mandalas panels' project. I'm really excited about.

My idea is start today doing:

## Sketches and drawing

The concept idea, is the user will control the "mandala's motor speed". So I think the accelerator will cover one rational rotation from 0.001 seconds to 3 seconds.

So, when the user comes into the main screen, they will see something like these:

![Mandalas panel sketch](../project_images/mandalas_panel_sketch.jpg?raw=true "Mandalas panel sketch")

The mandalas was not painted because it's the sketch. But, each small circle on these sketch represents one mandala.

![When one mandala is selected](../project_images/when_one_mandala_is_selected.jpg?raw=true "When one mandala is selected")

So you can accelerate the mandala independently.


## The state of art

So, the idea is turn the mandalas from these 3 pocket books coloured in version accessible.

![The 3 little books](../project_images/the_mandalas_books.jpg?raw=true "The books")

As my code start rotate with a simple css. My initial job now is create the project structure and start implementing part by part of the sketches.

For do that, I need to take pictures of all the mandalas:



1. 46 mandalas - 21 missing to colour - from [Christian Pilastre](http://www.vieuxsalydieu.com/mandala.html)
2. 46 mandalas - 11 missing to colour - from [Marie Pré](http://www.mariepre.net/)
3. 36 mandalas - 22 missing to colour - from Françoise Rougeau

    All the image rights is from the authors, and my idea is just show the colourization made by me and my friends.
    I'm contacting the authors to guarantee everything is right into the law too.

So, the prototype panel will start with 48 already coloured mandalas.

These 3 little books was circulating between my friends and everybody enjoy the art therapy proccess.

Now, until 28 march, these 3 books will continue circulating to be coloured by anyone who wants to participate :)

I think I'll allow the users to upload their own mandalas in the future too, or even work with [GeoKone](http://geokone.net) awesome app.
