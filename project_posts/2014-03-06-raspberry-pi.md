# Raspberry PI

After a long time with no success trying to put my beaglebone black up, I really agree I brick it or something like that.

No success trying to reflash the emmc or booting via sdcard.

It's the early model in the market and the community had some problems like me. I tried like them, but didn't work.

So, I need to continue, and I decide to buy the rpi because it's a popular model in the market. I get the model B.

These time I got a case to keep the board safe and buy a compatible wifi too. I really disklike ethernet cables.

Yesterday I bought one more servo motor with the PWM module controller. 

## 3d printer

Yesterday I was trying to print some mandalas in 3d and the Kapton tape that protects the heated bed just was obstrused by the extrusor.

I can't continue printing with these obstrusion, so I order other Kapton thermical tape to protect the heated bed.

The RepRap is really sensible and the Z position comes 0.000n milimiters out of the perfection it start tracing the bed. The Z position should be aligned every time the printer is used.

## Fifth post

I'm happy because it's my fifth post and I'm really doing the project.

Face the developer life looks like a novel and I'm feeling in the most "important" chapters.

Now I have these week waiting the products come in home. It's really hard to believe my beaglebone black stopped and I didn't get it fixed.

I'll get concentrated in put the original copy and feed the authors and other meta info about the mandalas on the website.
